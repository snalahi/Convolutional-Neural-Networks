# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
`*` => means convolution in neural network and elementwise multiplication in python.

#### Suppose, we have an input matrix of shape (6x6) and the kernel(filter) applied is of the shape (3x3). Then the output matrix shape will be (4x4). The actual formula here: if input matrix is of shape (nxn) and kernel is of shape (fxf) then the output matrix will be of shape (n-f+1 x n-f+1).
#### If we introduce padding, p then the formula of the shape of output matrix will be (n+2p-f+1 x n+2p-f+1).

As the value of an image matrix moves towards zero or negative, the associated pixel gets darker. So, moving towards zero or negative one or so on exhibits darker shades while high values express brighter shades.
