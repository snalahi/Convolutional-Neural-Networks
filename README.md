# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
* => means convolution in neural network and elementwise multiplication in python.

Suppose, we have an input matrix of shape (6x6) and the kernel(filter) applied is of the shape of (3x3). Then the output matrix should calculated as 6x6 = 36 / (3x3) = 36 / 9 = 4. Output shape will be (4x4) matrix.
